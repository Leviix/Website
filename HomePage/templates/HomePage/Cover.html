        About Myself:
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-content">
        I'm currently employed, working as a full time commercial construction labourer at Mapel Builing,
        I started part time right after finishing high school back in 2015, although I enjoy what I do,
        working with them as a labourer is not a career it is simply a job to keep the wheel truning,
        nothing more, I'm eager and hungry for more. I have little experience outside of this job which
        might turn most away but I never turn down a challenge and I take pride in what I do but I'm
        always open to cunstructive criticism and other ways of doing things. <br>
        <br>
        I'm reaching above my belt for this position, I'm yet to complete a university degree
        I currently hold an Australian divers license,
